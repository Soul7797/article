        <h2>Godfrey: The Latest Tesla FSD Update</h2>
        <p>
          The new Godfrey update pushes the boundaries of autonomous driving. It
          harnesses full-resolution AI4 video inputs, native AI4 neural network
          architectures, and unprecedented training compute resources to deliver
          a smoother, safer, and more efficient driving experience. Whether
          navigating city streets or cruising highways, Godfrey adapts
          seamlessly to real-world conditions, providing dynamic routing around
          closures, improved collision avoidance, and more intuitive speed
          profiles.
        </p>
